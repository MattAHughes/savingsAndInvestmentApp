# savingsAndInvestmentApp
An app to predict savings and investment growth, with visual layouts and plots as well as potential user-defined input for comparison.

This set of programs generates a GUI using PYQT5 which plots and tabulates predicted savings and investment values over time. User parameters can be input on the first three tabs, which may be saved or discarded as required.

The current version includes filtering to attempt to make sure user inputs are of the forms required for the app operation, and checks upon exit if the program registers unsaved changes across any of the user input parameters or tables.
